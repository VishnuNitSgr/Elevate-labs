# Elevate-labs

During my internship training, I gained hands-on experience with MySQL, deepening my understanding of relational database concepts and SQL operations. The training focused on building a strong foundation in database design, data manipulation, and query execution.

I practiced creating databases and tables, inserting and managing records, and executing SQL queries to verify, analyze, and manipulate data. These exercises gave me insight into how databases are structured and how data is efficiently stored, retrieved, and maintained in real-world applications.

This internship enhanced my practical MySQL skills, strengthened my problem-solving abilities, and prepared me to work confidently with databases in backend development and software projects.
